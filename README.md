# Pyro(raptor)

> The static documentation site generator for Deno

⚡️ Pyro will help you ship a **beautiful documentation site in no time**.

💸 Building a custom tech stack is expensive. Instead, **focus on your content**
and just write Markdown files.

💥 Ready for more? **Advanced features** like versioning, i18n, search and theme
customizations are built-in with zero config required.

🧐 Pyro at its core is a **static-site generator**. That means it can be
deployed **anywhere**.
